/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Prasthan Connect Website
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and allows public read access for gallery items, team members, and sponsors. Contact form submissions
 * are left open for prototyping but should be restricted to authenticated users or admins in a production environment.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * - /contactFormSubmissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}: Stores contact form submissions. In a production environment,
 *   access should be restricted to authenticated users or admins.
 * - /galleryItems/{galleryItemId}: Stores publicly accessible gallery items.
 * - /teamMembers/{teamMemberId}: Stores publicly accessible team member information.
 * - /sponsors/{sponsorId}: Stores publicly accessible sponsor information.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User data is secured via path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}`), ensuring that only the
 *   authenticated user can access their own data.
 * - Public read access is granted for gallery items, team members, and sponsors to allow for
 *   unauthenticated access to website content.
 * - Contact form submissions are currently open but should be secured in a production
 *   environment to prevent unauthorized access.
 * - No user listing is allowed to prevent enumeration of user accounts.
