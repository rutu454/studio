/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a default-deny policy. All reads and writes are
 * disallowed unless explicitly permitted by a rule. For this application,
 * since admin authentication is handled statically in the application code,
 * there is no need for Firestore-based access control for the admin panel.
 * The contact form submissions are write-only for any user.
