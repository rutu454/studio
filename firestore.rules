/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset governs access to the `contactFormSubmissions` collection, which stores data from contact form submissions.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: All contact form submissions are considered public write-only. There is no access control based on user identity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/contactFormSubmissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}`: Stores contact form submissions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Contact form submissions are write-only, meaning anyone can submit the form.
 * - Listing and getting of existing contact form submissions are explicitly denied.
 * - No user authentication or ownership is enforced, as this is a public-facing contact form.
