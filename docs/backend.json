    "reasoning": "Given the requirements for a static organizational website with Firebase Authentication for Prasthan Group, the Firestore structure is designed to primarily store data related to users and contact form submissions. The key focus is on enabling secure access to user data and managing contact form information efficiently. This structure prioritizes simplicity and ease of maintenance since most of the website content is static.\n\nThe `users/{userId}` collection stores user profiles. This is a path-based ownership model, providing excellent security and manageability. No denormalization is required here, as access control is directly based on the authenticated `userId`.\n\nThe `contactFormSubmissions` collection stores submissions from the contact form. This collection is intended to be accessed by admins (not implemented here, but the structure allows for it) and does not require user-specific access control. Therefore, it resides at the root level. If admin roles were implemented, a separate `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection would be used to manage admin privileges without custom claims.\n\nThis design achieves Authorization Independence because user data is secured via path-based ownership, eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules. QAPs are supported inherently by segregating user data and contact form submissions into separate collections with distinct security postures.  The `users` collection is secured using the `request.auth.uid == userId` pattern, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.  The `contactFormSubmissions` collection, designed for potential admin access, can be secured using an existence check against a `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection (not implemented in this response due to the prompt's constraints, but structurally supported)."
